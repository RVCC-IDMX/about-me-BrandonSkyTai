            <h2>Working Title</h2>

            <div id="litcenter">

                <p>The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband
                    closer to her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head
                    proudly, and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and kissing it
                    reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that of her husband, who held his other arm
                    thrown round her protectingly. After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she
                    began:--</p>

                <p>"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a long time it did not act. I
                    seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all
                    of them connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble." Her husband
                    involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly: "Do not fret, dear. You must be brave
                    and strong, and help me through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me to
                    tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I need your help. Well, I saw I
                    must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely
                    set myself to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more. Jonathan
                    coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember.</p>

                <p>There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I forget now if you
                    know of this; you will find it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague
                    terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence. I turned to wake Jonathan,
                    but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping
                    draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I looked
                    around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of
                    the mist--or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely
                    disappeared--stood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the
                    others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line; the
                    parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to
                    see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the red scar on his
                    forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have
                    screamed out, only that I was paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,
                    pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--</p>

                <p>Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes.' I was
                    appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon
                    my shoulder and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did so, 'First, a
                    little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well be quiet; it is not the first time, or
                    the second, that your veins have appeased my thirst!' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did
                    not want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is, when his touch is
                    on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!" Her
                    husband groaned again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if he were the
                    injured one, and went on:--</p>
