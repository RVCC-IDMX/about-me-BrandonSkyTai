            <p>
              
                 This is my about me, so let me tell you a bit about me. My full name is Brandon Sky Tai. I am Taiwanese and Cantonese but I was born here in New Jersey. I grew up with just an older brother and my mother. 
                I like to do a lot of things like playing video games, collecting shoes, creating designs and clothes, watching anime/movies/shows, and I love cars. Some of my dreams include being an architect or at least design my own house, and have my clothing brand gain mainstream popularity. I have a lot of passion for my brand. 
                I have many favorite video games I grew up playing them since as young as I can remember since my brother was 8 years older than me he always had some gaming device like N64, Game Cube, all the different Game Boys, PS2, XBOX 360, XBOX One, XBOX Series X and PC. I built my own PC. 
                I have so many different shoes that I don't even wear them all. More than 15 pairs in my closet and more that I wear daily. I have lots of clothes too that I mainly thrifted which is also how my clothing brand kind of started. I used to thrift clothes and wanted to touch em up with my ideas. I learned to sew and hem and that led me to start 
                ordering blanks so I can start selling them since my friends always asked me to make them one. I love anime I started watching them as long as I can remember too because of my asian background it was never weird to me and my cousin showed me a bunch of Ghibli films I enjoyed it because now I watch all kinds of Animes.
                I also like shows like Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead. Rick Grimes is probably my favorite character of all time. One of my favorite types of video games are racing games, I grew up with Need for Speed and thats where my love for cars began. My number one dream car is a Dodge Viper.

            <h2>Adding a Blur and Enlarging effect on Hover</h2>

            <div id="litcenter">

                <p> If you want to add a nice effect on your images to make them pop and add some jazz to your page,
                    the blur and enlarge effects can add visual interest and emphasis to images on a web page. They can help draw the user's attention to a specific image and make it stand out from the rest.
                    Additionally, the blur effect can also help create a sense of focus and clarity by blurring out the surrounding content. This can be particularly useful when an image is the main focus of a page or section, and you want the user to be able to view it clearly.
                    Overall, these effects can be a useful way to enhance the visual appeal of images on a web page and make them more engaging for the user. First we have the Enlarge effect which enlarges an image
                    on a hover which is good for smaller screens where you are trying to make the image bigger without
                    compromising the layout of the page and even on normal size screens to help focus on the picture and
                    even help the visitors see the picture better. Next is the blur effect, a really cool effect that
                    blurs out everything but the picture you are hovering over. It adds emphasis on the picture you want to
                    see and also helps the visitor focus on the image incase they have a hard time focusing on a single
                    image when there are multiple nearby.
                </p>

                <p> To start, let's begin with the enlarge on hover effect. First you want to find the image on the page
                    you want to apply the effect to. For this example I will use <br> "&lt;img src="img/shoes-640w.jpg"
                    alt="a bunch of left shoes"&gt;" In the div you want to add class so that you can target that specific image. " &lt;div
                    class="grow"&gt; " <br> and put the img into the div class. <br> &lt;div class="grow"&gt; <br> &lt;img src="img/shoes-640w.jpg" alt="a bunch of left shoes"&gt; <br> &lt;/div&gt; <br> Then in your style.css create a line for the image. ".grow img { }" Inside the brackets you will
                    write "transitions: 1000ms;" formated like so. <br> ".grow img{ <br> transition: 1000ms; <br> }" <br> This is setting the time it
                    takes for the scaling to happen. 1000ms is 1second. Continuing in the css make a new line for the hover effect. The following ".grow img:hover { }"
                    Then fill in the following the brackets with <br> ".grow img:hover { <br> -webkit-transform: scale(1.4); <br> -ms-transform: scale(1.4); <br> transform: scale(1.4); <br> transition: 1000ms ease; <br> }"
                    <br>  These webkits are used to target specific browsers and ensure that the styles are applied correctly. The scale property is used to specify how the element should be transformed, in this case by scaling it up by 1.4 times its original size.
                    After this the hover effect should be applied and when you put your cursor over the image the photo should now enlarge. 
                </p>

                <p> Moving on to the next effect we are going to add a blur effect to everything but the image you hover over. First lets start by putting everything we just did in html into a div. We will call it blur. <br>
                    &lt;div class="blur"&gt; <br> &lt;div class="grow"&gt; <br> &lt;img src="img/shoes-640w.jpg" alt="a bunch of left shoes"&gt; <br> &lt;/div&gt; <br> &lt;/div&gt;
                    <br> And then we will create another div inside that div called card. <br> 
                    &lt;div class="blur"&gt; <br> &lt;div class="card"&gt; <br> &lt;div class="grow"&gt; <br> &lt;img src="img/shoes-640w.jpg" alt="a bunch of left shoes"&gt; <br> &lt;/div&gt; <br> &lt;/div&gt;
                    <br> Next open the css file. Going to create a new line targeting the div class="blur" <br> ".blur { <br> display: flex; <br> justify-content: space-evenly; <br> }" <br>
                    Now create one targeting div class="card" by doing the following<br>
                    ".card { <br> padding: 10px; <br> margin: 0px 10px; <br> text-align: center; <br> transition: 500ms; <br> }" <br> This is adding some style to the div. Time to create the hover effect for the blur. Create a new line for the hover effect like so. <br>
                    ".blur:hover .card { <br> filter: blur(10px); <br> }" <br> This creates a blur effect when you hover over the image but it also blurs out the image, so let's fix that. Create a new line for this <br> 
                    ".profile .card:hover { <br> filter: blur(0px); <br> }" <br> To prevent the image itself from being blurred, the .profile .card:hover selector is used to target .card elements that are within a .profile container that is being hovered over. When this happens, 
                    the filter property is applied with a blur value of 0px, which removes the blur effect from the image. This can be a useful way to create visual emphasis and focus on a specific image within a grid of images.
                <br><br>
                
                
                    If you followed these steps correctly your code should work and the image you applied this to should behave like this: <li><a href="#gallery">Photos</a></li>
