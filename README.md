This purpose of this project is to create a website that details me, hence the name, About Me. At first we learned to put simple text on the screen and import some images to place. Creating sections with ID's and Divs to help organize our code.Then we learned some CSS to help stylize our page to make it our own, making sure we had good contrast on the page to help people with vision disabilties and other things like fonts and borders, spacing, centering, drop caps, flex grid rows and columns, blocks. After all that we had to make sure our designs worked for different platforms like mobile phones, tablets and desktops so we created break points to change the css elements to work across the platforms. Then we embedded a video into our page. I chose a video I created on youtube. Finally I added a contact form so that the visitors could say something about the page or ask questions. Lastly I added a Nav Bar so that the visitors can jump around the page easier.

For the color scheme of the website I chose the colors grey as the background and a darker purple for the text and headers, and detailed elements are in orange because it is the complementary color of purple and provides a nice contrast element across the page. The hex code are the following

Background: #c7c7c7
Text: #5d289e
Details: #ffb01e
